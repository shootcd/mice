Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that gives machines the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages. 
It is used in many applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more. 
Text summarization is a subtask of NLP that aims to produce a concise and meaningful summary of a longer text. 
There are two main types of summarization: extractive and abstractive. 
Extractive summarization picks important sentences from the text, while abstractive summarization generates new sentences to capture the meaning.
